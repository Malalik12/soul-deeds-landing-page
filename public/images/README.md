## How to Add Images to This Project

This folder is intended for the static image assets used in the Soul Deeds landing page. In a Next.js project, the `public` directory is the correct place for assets like images, fonts, etc.

To make your images appear correctly, please save your image files in this `public/images` directory with the following exact names:

- `phone-mockup-1.png` (The front-most phone in the hero section)
- `phone-mockup-2.png` (The phone behind the main one in the hero section)
- `why-us-1.png` (The top image in the "Why We're Doing This" section)
- `why-us-2.png` (The bottom image in the "Why We're Doing This" section)
- `what-you-get-1.png` (Top-left image in "What You'll Get")
- `what-you-get-2.png` (The main, larger image in "What You'll Get")
- `what-you-get-3.png` (Bottom-left image in "What You'll Get")
- `cta-illustration.svg` (The illustration in the final call-to-action section)

Make sure the file extensions match. When referencing these images in your components, use a path starting from the root, like `/images/phone-mockup-1.png`.
