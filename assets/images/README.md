## How to Add Images to This Project

This folder is intended for the static image assets used in the Soul Deeds landing page.

To make your images appear correctly, please save your image files in this `assets/images` directory with the following exact names:

- `phone-mockup-1.png` (The front-most phone in the hero section)
- `phone-mockup-2.png` (The phone behind the main one in the hero section)
- `why-us-1.png` (The top image in the "Why We're Doing This" section)
- `why-us-2.png` (The bottom image in the "Why We're Doing This" section)
- `what-you-get-1.png` (Top-left image in "What You'll Get")
- `what-you-get-2.png` (The main, larger image in "What You'll Get")
- `what-you-get-3.png` (Bottom-left image in "What You'll Get")
- `cta-illustration.svg` (The illustration in the final call-to-action section)

Make sure the file extensions match. If you use `.jpg` or another format, you will need to update the image paths in the component files (e.g., `Hero.tsx`, `WhyUs.tsx`, etc.). It is recommended to use PNGs with transparent backgrounds where appropriate, especially for the phone mockups.
